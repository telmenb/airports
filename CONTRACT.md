# Team Contract

## Communication
### Team Meetings:
Our team will have a mandatory Wednesday at 5-7pm and optional Saturday meetings. Meetings will be ideally held in person with virtual meetings as a backup. Wednesday meetings will serve as an opportunity to touch-base and reflect on progress, as well as plan out goals for the week; and Saturday meetings will be a designated time to gather and work on the project together. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Anish Sabnish (anishks2), then Telmen Bayarsaikhan (tbayar2) -> Andrew Chemaly (chemaly3) -> Varik Gurdson (gilmer2). Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s Tuesday meeting.

### Assistance:
Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, or Snapchat. Outside of emergencies, we commit to responding to emails or other forms of communication within 24 hours.

### Respect:
The note-taker for the week will also act as the “project lead” for the Wednesday meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the team has had the opportunity to speak or state their opinion on a design decision or any other aspect of the project. All decisions will be made by ¾ majority. In the event that the vote is evenly split among members, the project lead will contact Teaching Assistant Sahil Agrawal (sahila4) to break the tie. If Agrawal is unable to respond within 24 hours, the decision will be made in favor of the project lead that week. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made during Wednesday meetings, regardless of whether they personally disagree with them.

## Collaboration
### Work Distribution:
Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined during our Wednesday meetings where each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. If there are no volunteers for a deliverable, the project lead for the week will choose two members to assign the task as a pair-programming objective. If this leads to an unbalanced distribution of work for the week, members are encouraged to speak out and adjustments will be made on a case-by-case basis.

### Time Commitment:
Each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a task ends up taking more time than anticipated, the rest of the team will be compelled to assist with the unfinished work, with each member taking an equal share of the workload to complete. It is the responsibility of the whole team, not the individual, to make sure deliverables are finished by the end of the week. However, if a team member is habitually unable to complete their tasks and fail to adequately communicate in advance or explain their circumstances, steps may be taken to contact course staff by the other team members

### Conflict Resolution:
Conflicts relating to design decisions will be addressed according to the method mentioned above in the Respect section. Habitual tardiness will be tolerated until the 3rd instance. On the 4th instance of a tardy, the team member will be asked to explain the circumstances and a dialogue will be opened whether meeting times should be adjusted. If performance doesn’t improve, course staff will be contacted to address the issue.
