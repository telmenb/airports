# Comments

You have made good progress so far and have finished the data extraction and pre-processing. You have also completed the DFS algorithm and written some test cases for it. 

The only suggestion I have is to also have test cases on the entire graph (if possible, consider some edge case and write a test case to ensure your algorithms work on those edge cases also)
