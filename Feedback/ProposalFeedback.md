# Comments

You have some minor flaws in the data and algorithms part and a major flaw as your proposal only has 2 major algorithms and lacks a concrete uncovered algorithm. 

**Dataset:** 

The data storage is not clearly explained, especially in the graphs portion, that is, how will you store the edges of a node in the graph.

Also, you don't mention how you will use the longitude and latitude data of the airports.

The Dijkstra's algorihtm requires weighted graphs, please specify what the weights of the graph will be and how you will get them.

**Algorithms:** 

What is the traversal you will be coding, BFS or DFS? For that, please specify what the input, output and running time will be.

The major flaw and the reason for the grade being "Incomplete" right now is that your third (uncovered) algorithm is just Dijkstra's along with graph coloring, which doesn't count. Please resubmit the proposal with an accepted uncovered algorithm (examples are present in the project goals doc; I would recommend something from among: strongly connected components, betweenness centrality, or a Eulerian path / cycle detection algorithm.)
